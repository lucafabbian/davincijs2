## Get started
*Note that you will need to have [Node.js](https://nodejs.org) installed.*

```bash
cd davincijs2
npm i # Install dependencies (only first time)
npm run dev # Run in dev mode with autoreload on save
```

Navigate to [localhost:10001/davincijs2/public](http://localhost:10001/davincijs2/public/index.html). You should see your app running. Edit a component file in `src`, save it, and reload the page to see your changes.
